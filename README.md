### About Me

👋 Hi there! I'm a computer science student passionate about software development and project management. With a year and a half left in my degree program, I'm focused on deepening my technical skills and exploring new challenges in the tech industry.

### My Projects

**🌐 Buzz - Social Media App:** Designed and developed a full-stack social media application using the MERN stack, featuring user authentication, post creation, a "friends" system, and the ability for users to "like" posts. These features enhance user interaction and create a dynamic, socially driven web experience.

**🐍 Snake Game on Raspberry Pi:** Developed a multi-level Snake game featuring SNES controller driver functionality, various game modes, scoring systems, timing, lives, value packs, and different obstacles. *(Private Repository)*

**💻 CPU Scheduler in C++:** Built a CPU scheduler to implement and understand different scheduling algorithms. *(Private Repository)*

**📊 Model Comparison Tool:** Created a tool for comparing regression models, calculating R² and MSE values to determine the best model for a given dataset. 

### Experience

**📈 Project Management Internship:** Currently interning at a project management consulting firm, where I’m gaining hands-on experience in managing and executing projects. I also worked on website cleanup, addressing SEO issues, and reformatting key components to enhance user experience and search engine performance.

### Goals

I'm committed to continuous learning and eager to work on projects that push my technical boundaries. While I'm keen to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios, my primary focus is on gaining meaningful experience and collaborating with others to create impactful solutions.
